## Development

### HTML

The HTML files (`index.html`, `About-the-team.html`, `Add-Products.html`,`edit-product.html`) define the structure and content of the website pages. Used HTML tags to organize content, create headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements.

### CSS

The CSS file (`style.css`) contains the styles and layout rules for the website. Used CSS selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles such as colors, fonts, margins, padding, and positioning.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) adds interactivity to the website. Used JavaScript to handle user interactions, perform form validation, manipulate the DOM, and make asynchronous requests to servers.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the website by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files according to your preferences. Experiment with different layouts, styles, and functionalities to enhance the website.
